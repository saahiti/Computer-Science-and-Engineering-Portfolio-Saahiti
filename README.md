Computer-Science-and-Engineering-Portfolio
==========================================

A collection of projects and source codes related to programming and engineering while in high school:

Programming projects include Chess in Java, Mastermind in Visual Basic (includes an executable), and a 
Calculator created in Python (check out the presentation describing its features). These projects were done in
collaboration with a partner. These programs include basic concepts such as GUI, 2D arrays, arraylists, 
nested loops, methods etc. and are significantly based on OOP design.

Computer engineering projects include a packaging factory with components such as photoresistors, 
SONAR detectors, servo motors and RC timing circuits. The SONAR distinguishes between products of different 
sizes by measuring its dimensions, while the colour sensor was coded to identify varying levels of resistances 
as different colours. A mini-vehicle was designed to collect the final products in a sorted fashion based on
size. The project was conceptualized by my partner Alisa, and me, and was constructed from raw materials. 
The implemenetation of the code was in Arduino.

Check out the video and images in the Packaging Factory section!!

As part of Computer Engineering, I was invoved in building a computer from scratch. The report summarizes the
process and specifications related to the computer.
